# Task 9 – Random Forest: Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Internship: AI & ML Internship

### Objective
To detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Random Forest while handling class imbalance and evaluating performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## Dataset
Credit Card Fraud Dataset (Kaggle)  
Stored locally in the repository under the `Database/` folder.

---

## Steps Performed
1. Dataset loading and imbalance analysis
2. Feature and target separation
3. Stratified train-test split
4. Baseline Logistic Regression model
5. Random Forest training
6. Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
7. Feature importance visualization
8. Model saving using joblib

---

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook
- Feature importance plot
- Saved Random Forest model (.pkl)

---

## Final Outcome
Understanding of ensemble learning and handling imbalanced datasets.
